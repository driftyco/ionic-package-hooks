# Ionic Package Hooks

The hooks in this repository are hooks that you can run during the packaging of
your app. Ionic Package uses Cordova, so these are just standard [Cordova
Hooks](http://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/edge/guide/appdev/hooks/index.html)
that we've selected/accepted.

To run these hooks in Ionic Package, just put a `<hook />` tag in your
`config.xml`, like this:

```xml
<hook type="after_prepare" src="package-hooks/add_platform_class.js" />
```

That's it! Package will run that hook on the server.

### Re-enable HTTP for iOS9

This is probably one of the main reasons you're here, so this is how you do
that:

* Put the following in your `config.xml`:

    ```xml
    <hook type="after_prepare" src="package-hooks/ios9_allow_http.sh" />
    ```
* That's it, actually. Run `ionic package build ios ...` again and your binary
  should allow HTTP.

### Use these hooks locally

You don't need to download these hooks locally, but **local builds won't work
without them**.

To use them locally, you can clone the repository within your Ionic App, and
Cordova will pick up your `<hook />` tags within `config.xml` automatically.

**Within your app directory**:
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-package-hooks.git ./package-hooks
$ cd package-hooks
$ npm install
```

### Hooks

These are the available hooks. The **type** is what you put in `type` of your
`<hook />` tag, unless you want to run the hook at a different stage (not
recommended). If you want a hook to run before another one, reorder the `<hook
/>` tags.
